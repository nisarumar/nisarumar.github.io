I am Umar. I am interested in the boundary where software interfaces with the hardware. I plan to host my content here as I navigate through the realm where (digital) logic meets (software) design.

A little about myself:
- I am an ECE graduate.
- I have done my master's from Technical University of Munich
- Currently employed as a SW Platform Application Engineer at Intel in Germany

You can find me on [Linkedin](https://de.linkedin.com/in/umar-nisar).
